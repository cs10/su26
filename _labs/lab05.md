# Lab 5: HOFs and Functions as Data

## Instructions
This worksheet serves as a guide and set of instructions to complete Lab 6. All material was sourced from the CS10 version of The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) course.

- You **must** use the [starter file, found here](https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=jedi_force&projectname=Lab9%20Starter) to get credit for the lab.  
- Additionally, here is the [workbook](https://cs10.org/bjc-r/llab/html/topic.html?topic=berkeley_bjc%2Fhofs%2Fhofs-practice.topic&course&novideo&noreading&noassignment) that you can read through for further context and additional (non-required) material.  
- Please note: The file name **does not equal the lab number!**

## Submitting
You will need to fill in the blocks under **“Lab 9 Starter”** and submit this to Gradescope (again, the file name does not equal the lab number!).  
- To receive full credit, you must complete the required blocks, and those blocks must pass all tests from the Gradescope autograder.  
- For instructions on how to submit labs to Gradescope, please see [this page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAcZc9ypX07-bt0gK6uQ4P-06SrjPRsgiOjERIOlvYU/edit?usp=sharing).
- ![run autograder]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_0.png)

Please note: you must use the **starter file** above, and you must **not** edit the name of any required blocks. Failing to do either will result in autograder failure.

## Objectives
Throughout the course, you’ve been exposed to HOF blocks like `map`, `keep`, and `combine`. You may have used them to carry out relatively simple tasks, like summing a list with `combine`, or filtering based on word length with `keep`. In this lab, you're going to attack some more complicated problems with the help of HOFs.  

By the end of the lab, you will be comfortable implementing and understanding:
- Build non-HOF blocks to use as helper functions in larger HOF problems
- Complete complex, multi-step HOFs problems
- Use HOFs to solve real-life problems, like minimizing or composing functions

## Required Blocks
- Block 1: is (num) a factorion?  
- Block 2: list all factorions between (num1) and (num2)  
- Block 3: is (num) pandigital?  
- Block 4: list all pandigital numbers between (num1) and (num2)

## Block 1: is (num) a factorion?
**Objective**  
- Create a predicate block that, when input with a number, reports if that number is a factorion (True/False).  
- A number is called a factorion if the number is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits.  
- Example: 145 is a factorion since 145 = 1! + 4! + 5!.  
- Please use HOFs in your solution.  

**Hint**: Filling out and using the `factorial (num)` block may be extremely helpful.  

**Inputs**  
- `num`: any number  

**Output**  
- Reports a **boolean** (`true` if factorion, otherwise `false`)  

**Examples**  
- ![example factorion check true for 145]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b1_2.png)  
- ![example factorion check false for 123]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b1_3.png)  
- ![example factorion check true for 40585]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b1_4.png)

## Block 2: list all factorions between (num1) and (num2)
**Objective**  
- Create a block that takes two numbers and returns all numbers (including num1 and num2) that are factorions in a list.  

**Inputs**  
- `num1`, `num2`: any numbers  

**Output**  
- Reports a **list** containing all factorions between (and including) num1 and num2  

**Examples**  
- ![example list factorions between 1 and 2000]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b2_1.png)  
- ![example list factorions between 1 and 50000]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b2_2.png)  

---

## Block 3: is (num) pandigital?
**Objective**  
- Create a predicate block that reports if the input number is pandigital.  
- A number is called pandigital if it uses all of the digits from 1 to n exactly once, where n is the number of digits in the number.  
  - Example: 15432 is pandigital, but 11132 is not.  

**Inputs**  
- `num`: any number  

**Output**  
- Reports a **boolean**  

**Examples**  
- ![example pandigital check true for 15432]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b3_1.png)  
- ![example pandigital check false for 11132]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b3_2.png)  
- ![example pandigital check true for 987654321]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b3_3.png)

## Block 4: list all pandigital numbers between (num1) and (num2)
**Objective**  
- Create a block that takes two numbers and lists all numbers (including num1 and num2) that are pandigital in a list.  

**Inputs**  
- `num1`, `num2`: any numbers  

**Output**  
- Reports a **list** containing all pandigital numbers between (and including) num1 and num2  

**Examples**  
- ![example list pandigital numbers between 100 and 500]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b4_1.png)  
- ![example list pandigital numbers between 1 and 10000]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab_images/lab6_b4_2.png)
